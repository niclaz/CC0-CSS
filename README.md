# events_web

Public repository of the code for web3privacy events webpages - [CC0 licensed](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/), built with simple web-standard HTML, CSS, and JS

**Please Note**: at this time the code herein is for the Web3Privacy Summit 2 - in future it will be edited to become a template that can be forked by any contributor that wishes to host an event and have a simple website to present it. 

## CONTENTS

- [ ] /fonts/            =  folder that holds all the fonts used by the website
- [ ] /img/              =  folder that holds all images used by the website
- [ ] index.html         =  what-you-code-is-what-you-get HTML
- [ ] w3pevent.css       =  CSS file for index.html (needs refinement)
- [ ] w3pevent.js        =  JS file for index.html (need refinement)

## COMMENTS
- If you see something broken or needs improving, fork the repo and submit a PR please
- All images used within website should be .png
- To change an image on the website you need to either replace the file in /img/ with one named exactly as it is online (i.e. privacy.png)
- To add an image you need the index.html to point to it /img/filename.png and add it to the /img/ with the same filename.
