# CC0-CSS

Public repository for a Creative Commons Zero **CCO** licensed Cascading Style Sheet **CCS** to be used by anyone for simple one-page event websites.

**Why?**

_I was getting annoyied at not being able to fully open source my webdev projects since many of the mainstream CSS frameworks are either closed-source or leverage a MIT/GPL license. Philosophically there is nothing wrong with these licenses, but since I could not find a CC0 licensed CSS framework... I coded it myself._

This repository uses HTML, images, and content from the [Web3Privacy Summit #2](https://github.com/web3privacy/events_web) as a sample content to test the new CSS code being written.

**Please advise** this code is still in development - do not use in production until v 1.0.

## CONTENTS

- [ ] /fonts/            =  folder that holds all the fonts used by the website (referenced in CSS)
- [ ] /img/              =  folder that holds all images used by the sample website
- [ ] index.html         =  what-you-code-is-what-you-get HTML (CCO licensed)
- [ ] cc0.css            =  CSS file for index.html
- [ ] favion.png         =  website favicon (should be placed in main folder of hosting)
